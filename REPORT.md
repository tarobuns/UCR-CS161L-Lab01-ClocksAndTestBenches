## Description of test cases
For the test cases, I added 2 additonal test cases. It was simple I think, unless the auto grader critiques my work and does not like it. First, I used a tick_100_5 value, which changed the trans_count to 50 because of how the clock works, where it is 5*(1000/100), because SRC_FREQ is 100, and the test runs for 1000 clock ticks. The result what the test case value of trans_count only changing. For tick_100_50 test case, the trans count was 500, and the original test case did not work until I changed count to be less than 1001.
